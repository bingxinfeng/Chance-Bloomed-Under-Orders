🌺“Chance Bloomed Under Orders” explores the relationship between the computational and the natural, decision and intangibility, orders and chance. All the decisions we make, all the commands we complied - where are they leading us into?

This project is a dynamic poster generating system.
The main visual of the poster - a flower, would be growing in many different ways depending on the audience's preferred decision. The project aims to explore the beauty of generative arts, as well as to reflect on the relationship between order and chaos, computing and nature, decision and intangibility.
 
> Order vs Chaos

> Computing vs Nature
 
In the process of studying programming and coding, I found that there're so many logics, so many debugs. But in computational arts, the relation between the artist and the computer is not just human-control-computer or computer-control-human. We don't control it, we let the chaos happen, we watch it, respond to it, and collaborate with it.
 
Also, reflecting on Henry Adams' "Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man." - when a computer is generating chaos, when we stop ordering the computer, the boundaries between order and chaos, between computing and nature are getting ambiguous. I think we actually study code to understand nature better.
 
> Decision VS Intangibility
 
The audience made decisions in the preset menu, as 'they were aware of whay they picked', however, they didn't know how the outcome poster would look like until the image completed its generating. So it's an experience that you thought you controlled everything, but there would be always something suprising you. So there is no 'completely control'.
